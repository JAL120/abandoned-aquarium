When it came to textures and portraying my theme through those textures this was a little difficult. To create an aquarium with the amount of dark textures I had was tough because most of the textures I had were dark metals but after experimenting over and over again I was able to stick around and use only 4-5 textures for the entire map. I was able to incorporate water which assisted in brightening up hallways and also giving a sense of movement back and forth. I also took advantage of my bright textures to give the illusion of fish tanks that travel through the hallways and are the center of specific rooms.
