When it came to textures and portraying my theme through those textures this was a little difficult. To create an aquarium with the amount of dark textures I had was tough because most of the textures I had were dark metals with extra details  but after experimenting over and over again I was able to stick around and use only 4-5 textures for the entire map. I was able to incorporate water which assisted in brightening up hallways and also giving a sense of movement back and forth. I also took advantage of my bright textures to give the illusion of fish tanks that travel through the hallways and are the center of specific rooms.

My textures give the essence of an aquarium but using water, blue textures, and blue metals.
