When it came to lighting an guidance, I took full advantage of the water pillars in the center of the 3 main floors to give the player the curious and animous feel like when you're in an aquarium. When you turn every corner you wonder which animal or exhibit you'll see next and that's what I try to mimic in my map.

The water inside the walls is also a good a great way to guide the player to each pillar and just around the map in general.
